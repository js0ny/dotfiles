* dotfiles
This repository contains dotfiles for multiple platforms, with /colemak/
as the default keyboard layout.

No rice, no Unixporn/NTporn, just a simple setup that works for me.

Works for Windows, Linux and MacOS.

** Setup


*** From Scratch (Linux/MacOS)

#+begin_src shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/js0ny/dotfiles/refs/heads/master/bootstrap/setup.sh -o setup.sh && chmod u+x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
#+end_src

*** Via =just= script

Make sure you have =just= installed

#+begin_src shell
which just
#+end_src

Then run

#+begin_src shell
just
#+end_src

This will list all available tasks.

All the just scripts are in =Justfile= and under =.just.d/= directory.
